# Introduction
Pizza is a great and yummy food consumed worldwide. according to wikipedia, more than 115 million kg of pizza is conumed daily worldwide. I came across this case study 2 of 8 weeks challenge which was organised by Danny Ma.

Danny Ma, the owner of a pizza empire requires the expertise of an Analyst who could help him clean his data and also carry out some basic calculations which will help him direct the runners operations and boost productivity.

# The Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was provided by Danny Ma and can be view using the link. it is made up of 6 tables which exist within the pizza_runner database schema. They are the runners tables, customers_orders, runner_orders, pizza_names, pizza_recipes and pizza_toppings tables respectively.

# Data Features

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning was done using SQL. Looking at some of the tables, they contain null values and wrong data types with inconsistent values. Using the COALESCE() function, I replaced the null values and changed the data types using the ALTER TABLE functions. I tackled the inconsistent values in the columns using the replace functions.
